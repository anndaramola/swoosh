A simple, slightly flirty, tool for adding all them hosts you be ssh'ing into. It's called `swoosh`, a term I got from Scott Hanselman a while ago.

I know there's the ~/.ssh/config file but I made this for fun. Feel free to do with it what you please.

Installation
* Clone this repo to your home directory.
* Update the path to the .sites file at the top of swoosh.sh
* Add the script to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_SWOOSH]"`
* Happy swooshing!
